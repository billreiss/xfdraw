# xfdraw

Work in progress. Accepting contributors. Draw to custom DrawingCanvas control using cross-platform drawing primitives. Create custom controls based on DrawingCanvas in shared code without extra custom renderers. 

XFDraw is meant to be lightweight, adding minimal size to your app. No extra dependencies on Android and iOS, UWP will require the Win2D library (additional 1MB).

For a more full featured library, take a look at SkiaSharp https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp this library is not meant to be a replacement for SkiaSharp, but only to provide a more lightweight option.
